# Pong
My first project involved creating a Java Pong game, which was more of a learning, creative, and problem-solving experience than a programming challenge. This straightforward yet timeless game provided a rich canvas on which to investigate a variety of Java programming topics, from basic visuals to reimagining the element of real-time user interaction.
The project started out with the specific objective of making a playable and entertaining recreation of the classic game "Pong." The first stage in this process needs to be constructing a solid foundation and outlining the essential elements of the game, which would include the ball, paddles, and playing field. At last, every one of these elements had been contained into a separate Java class starting with an organized structure

It turned out that the Ball class growth was very fascinating. Through the use of inheritance, one of the most crucial ideas in object-oriented programming, it replaced the inherited version of the Java language method. This made collision detection and recognition of when a collision occurs easier, which is essential to the game's operation. The ball initially moved randomly, which added dynamic to the action since it required the player to be proactive and have rapid reflexes.

I was able to understand how Java handles event manipulation thanks to the Paddle class. It was necessary to detect keystrokes and releases with extreme responsiveness and accuracy since the paddles were being controlled by keyboard entries. My comprehension of Java's event listening mechanisms has been considerably strengthened by the development of this functionality. By clearly separating the parts that are under player control, the decision to change the colour of the paddles improved the game's aesthetic appeal while also improving its usability.
The core of the GamePanel class was the game itself, which used all of its parts and subdivisions to handle the logical portion and rendering. In addition, the game loop—a crucial idea in the game creation process—was covered in this class.

In addition, the game loop—a crucial idea in the game creation process—was covered in this class. In addition to being difficult, controlling the order and timing of the game's events—such as moves, collisions, and scoring—rewarded my efforts. This one piece of data was sufficient to highlight the importance of accuracy and efficiency in engineering games.

This was accomplished by using Java's Swing library with the GameFrame class to set up the game's graphical user interface. This made a significant contribution to making sure the game is both user-friendly and presentable. One of the main things that made the game look professional was the care used to prevent resizing and to start the window in a way that it can appear at the middle.

In summary, creating the Java version of the Pong game has been a wonderful experience that goes beyond simple coding. It combined critical thinking, imaginative packaging, and hands-on learning. This project has improved my technical proficiency while also giving me a more profound understanding of gaming in a more sinister sense.
